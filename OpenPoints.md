# Open Points regarding our implementation

## ToDos:
- [ ] Make Package / Component render according to elements in it
- [ ] Manual Resizing
- [ ] Comments relation edge (either directly or as extra edge via palette)
- [ ] Palette Icons
- [ ] Order in which elements are displayed (e.g. parent always last)
- [ ] Rendering of text from actors where to place it
- [ ] Package shape -> box with small box at right top corner
- [ ] Add Extensions directly to extension points


- [ ] Abgabe Paper


## Nice to have: 
- [ ] multiline comments

## If time allows (i.e. never)
- [ ] Improve pattern matcher for multiplicity regex


## Questions
- why do we need to have new java classes for every element even if they all do exactly the same
- ```yarn start``` always tries to start the glsp server even if it is already running from eclipse

## Open Issues
- Saving not always consistent / consequent
- Palette is not always rendered
